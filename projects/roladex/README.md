Roladex (beta)
=======

Plugin for displaying content like a roladex (or a train terminal time display). The core visual effect is achieved with CSS rotation, animation, and some skillful positioning. So as expected, webkit rocks it, firefox does a pretty good job, and it gracefully degrades for o<b>I</b>d<b>E</b>r browsers.




Requires:
- jQuery 1.8.1 or above
-
